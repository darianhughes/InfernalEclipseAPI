	TBRNotice: NOTICE: It is detected that you have Thorium Bosses Reworked enabled! Make sure the Health, Damage, & Speed multipliers are set to 1 in the compatibility config (unless you want a harder experience) as this mod automatically adjusts the Thorium bosses depending on the current difficulty.
	TBRWarning: WARNING: It is detected that you do not have Thorium Bosses Reworked enabled! This mod is heavily recommended as it rebalances Thorium Bosses to have mechanics more in-line with Infernum mode and Calamity in general.
	RagWarning: WARNING: It is detected that you do not have Ragnarok enabled! Without this mod, Thorium & Calamity may not work well together. It is heavily recommended you enable this mod for a more complete & balanced experience
	EventTrophyNotice: NOTICE: It is detected that you do not have More Trophies and Relics enabled! Without this mod, any bosses that aren't from Vanilla, Calamity, or Infernum may not have Calamity lore or Infernum intros. It is heavily recommended you enable this mod for a more complete & balanced experience.
	SoulsWarning: WARNING: It is detected that you have the Fargo's Souls Mod enabled! Please note that Infernum Mode is not compatiable with Eternity Mode and you may expirence major bugs if you have both enabled.

	InfernumActive: The prodigy has returned to face the Infernal Eclipse...
	MPConnect: A prodigy has returned to help face the Infernal Eclipse...
	InfernumForced: Infernal energy has been infused into this world...
	RagnarokBalance: NOTICE: For the Balancing of weapons to be as intended, set the Ragnarok mod config of 'Generic Weapon Tweaks' to OFF, as otherwise the changes will stack and weapons will be far stronger than intended.

Lore: {
	Abom:
		'''
		The middle child of the eternal siblings, and one of the laziest people I've ever seen.
		While the Abominationn has the ability to fully control the weather and fully turn away invaders, 
		he truly is super lazy, going to the point of even fusing his weapons to his hands.
		His weapon has the ability to divide the soul itself, and has the ability to use all supernatural phenomena. 
		Good thing for you he choose not to use any celestial attacks out of respect of the Mutant, or else your victory might have not been possible.
		'''
	Devi:
		'''
		The youngest of the eternal siblings, and also the weakest.
		She has collected a bunch of rare monster items throughout her journey and when in a helping mood, she will sell them to others.
		However, when she isn't in a helping mood, she fully expresses her lovestruck sadism.
		The Deviantt has the ability to cast spells using the both the primordial light and pure love, all while using a living axe made of evil.
		Even though you bested her in combat, she seems to not fear death, and this is the first time I have ever seen her go all out in a fight.
		'''
	Mutant:
		'''
		The oldest and strongest of the eternal siblings.
		While the other siblings calls the Mutant their brother, he personally refuses to confirm his gender.
		He is the keeper of eternity, with ultimate power incarnate, and is believed to have come from another world beyond that dimensional rift.
		Other than you, he is the strongest being to ever grace the land of Terraria, with master of dominion over every aspect to combat.
		Even though he had all this power, he always was more interested in watching other battles in the world than partake in any himself. 
		He always told people that he was looking for someone strong and it looks like he found the person he was looking for.
		'''
	DylanLore:
		'''
		Hmm ... I'm surprised that you even know of that person.
		The first time we found him we thought he was a god ... however, ends up he didn't actually have a auric soul.
		We took him in and he showed us how to make powerful elemental imbued gear and bombs that wasn't just steel.
		His ideas had helped increase my army's power by a lot, but he never fought himself.

		One day when I went to his room, but nothing was there expect from a note.
		We couldn't translate his writing but from the pictures it was some sort of ring,
		with one of the key ingredients appering to be a "Dark Sun Ring."
		Perhaps that "Guide" could help you further decipher this note.
		Regardless, I'm sure you'll figure out how to make it.

		–Stay tuned for the future of Infernal Eclipse of Ragnarok!–
		'''
	DylanSoltan:
		'''
		Whoever is reading this note, be aware:
		I foresee a person who goes by the name of Soltan to emerge in the future.
		Many will think he is annoying, so I designed this chipnote to be of use to you.
		To combat his annoying nature, the mircochip attached to this note will convert all
		local summoning power into power for other sources.
		In addition, it gives you full permission to bully Soltan.
		I have only made two of these, and gave them to the two most powerful beings I could find.
		If you are one of those people, or someone else, use this device wisely...

	MysteriousDiary:

		Turning to page one, you see nothing except a few words.

		“Who the hell am I, that I still get to live a life?”

		The rest of the pages are blank...

		'''
	Provi:
		'''
		I dreamt of peace once. I don't know why I did.
		Ever since I received word that there was something beyond this world,
		I've have felt that womans presence in our world every now and again.
		Now what Thorne wanted from her? Who knows.
		But all the power is in your hands now, Terrarian.
		'''
	Mirror:
		'''
		I stared into it for a long while, but like any other mirror, I only saw myself.
		But even then, something felt... different. It felt wrong, almost... twisted.
		I disregarded it. But even now, I can feel the piercing gaze my reflection had... shooting directly through my skull.
		Once you come so far, the hardest part of your journey is facing yourself.
		'''
	Subspace:
		'''
		There lies tales of mysterious serpent‑like beings that roam the manifold between dimensions.
		Many say that they are too dangerous to face alone,
		and that they could kill anyone within an instant with the void energy they possess.
		This one, however... is clearly juvenile.
		'''
	Polaris:
		'''
		When I had initially brought Draedon onto my army, he had immediately began work on a supposed  "secret project" that he refused to elaborate on.
		Soon after, he presented his first grim death machine.
		I knew it was fit for my army, however, his prowess shown was... promising. Very much so.
		'''
	Putrid:
		'''
		A failed experiment, it would seem.
		It has a certain hunger for Peanuts that grow on the surface, though the reasoning is unknown.
		It is nowhere near the strength of some of the other gelatinous threats of this world,
		but it was still formidable irregardless.
		'''
	Lux:
		'''
		While the Hallow has many that protect it, chaos spirits have no equal.
		None of them had ever been sufficiently weakened for intelligent use,
		and Draedon ended up shoving them into constructs for the sole purpose of containment.
		With this in mind, it is odd that collector once again came to absorb what was left of its energy after its defeat.
		How quaint.
		'''
	Pharoah:
		'''
		There was once a Pharaoh in the deserts here.
		This sandy kingdom was his, and he ruled over it with a golden fist.
		It is a shame his curse claimed his life; I had a feeling he would have made a formidable ally in my army.
		Now all that remains is his buried tomb.
		'''
	Advisor:
		'''
		Unlike most creatures, I know not of this "Advisor" or its origins
		However, it seemed to be much in tune with the void energy lying deep within the crust of Terraria.
		As who chained it to the Planetarium? I couldn't tell you. 
		Maybe you could find the answers of that secret from the collector that absorbed its essence after its defeat.
		'''
	Glowmoth:
		'''
		This moth‑like creature is interesting, as it makes its homes within the same glowing, mushroom‑infested caves as another similar beast.
		It seems to emit some sort of bioluminescent glow, reminiscent of the void...
		perhaps it resides in these caves for their latent void energy?
		Whatever the case may be, it is beyond me.
