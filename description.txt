In the future, this will be a content mod that has it's own story including each of the mods in the associated mod pack in the future, with a functional Quest Book & Boss progression using tPackBuilder & the tools provided by the Bereft Souls team.

The mod pack was designed with Multiplayer compatibility in mind, but there are still no promises that this will work fully yet, as we am still testing and developing it.

Thank you to the Bereft Souls team, our donors, each of our contributors, and each of the individuals for each mod in the associated mod pack for making this possible!
