Infernal Eclipse of Ragnarok
An Ultramodded Infernum Modpack
This is just the API for the mod pack. Check out the mod pack here:

This will be a content mod that has it's own story including each of the mods in the mod pack in the future, with a functional Quest Book & Boss progression using tPackBuilder.

Infernal Eclipse of Ragnarok is a ultra modded pack designed for Calamity's Infernum Mode which includes these content mods:
	- Calamity Mod (obviously)
	- Thorium Mod
	- Secrets of the Shadows
	- Consolaria

The mod pack also has support for Spooky Mod, but isn't included in the mod pack.

This API currently adds the following:
	- Toggleable balance changes to many of the included mods to help the experience flow together better.
	- Boss stat adjustments for Infernum mode to keep the difficulty consistent.
	- Boss Rush support for all included bosses.
	- Custom Boss Rush music for tiers 5 & 6
	- Some fixes to help Infernum more multiplayer compatible.

Currently, Calamity: Wrath of the Gods doesn't function properly in Multiplayer, so if you plan to play multiplayer, you will unfortunately have to remove that pack from the mod pack until they get it fixed. Otherwise, the mod pack was designed with Multiplayer compatibility in mind, but there are still no promises that this will work fully yet, as I am still testing and developing it.

If you have any other issues please report them in the discord (https://discord.gg/RXdTXbKY). 

Thank you to the tPackBuilder team, as well as each of the individuals for each mod in the mod pack for making this possible!
