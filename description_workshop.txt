Infernal Eclipse of Ragnarok is an ultra-modded Infernum Mode addon which currently includes major support for these content mods included in the associated mod pack:
[list]
	[*] Calamity Mod (obviously)
	[*] Thorium Mod
	[*] Secrets of the Shadows
	[*] Consolaria
[/list]

As well minor support for these content mods & add-ons:
[list]
	[*] Spooky Mod
	[*] Spooky Bard, Healer, & Thrower
	[*] Fargo's Souls
	[*] Calamity - Fargo's Souls DLC
	[*] Community Souls Expansion
[/list]

The only mods required for this API to run are Calamity Mod, Infernum Mode, Revengence+, Thrower Unification, You, and any dependency included with those mods.

This API currently adds the following:
[list]
	[*] Toggleable balance changes to many of the included mods to help the experience flow together better.
	[*] Merged crafting trees for many accessories
	[*] A new rogue/thrower class merge system with custom stealth strikes for some Thorium thrower weapons.
	[*]	Some cross-mod Infernum intros.
	[*] Boss stat adjustments for Infernum mode to keep the difficulty consistent.
	[*] Boss Rush support for all included bosses, as well as a custom "tier 6."
	[*] New music for certain points of the game.
	[*] Some fixes to help Infernum more multiplayer compatible.
	[*] Some minor cross-mod improvements for other mods outside main mod pack.
[/list]

In the future, this will be a content mod that has its own story, including each of the mods in the mod pack in the future, with a functional reworked boss progression using the QuestBookUI & tPackBuilder.

The mod pack was designed with Multiplayer compatibility in mind, but there are still no promises that this will work fully yet, as I am still testing and developing it.

Also check out [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3452171528&searchtext=tpackbuilder] WHummus' Calamity/Thorium Balancing[/url] mod, as most of the item balance changes in this mod came from that mod and were created by him!

Very special thanks to the Bereft Souls & Community Souls Expansion teams, as well as each of the individuals for each mod in the mod pack for making this possible.
