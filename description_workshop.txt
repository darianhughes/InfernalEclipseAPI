Infernal Eclipse of Ragnarok is an ultra-modded Infernum Mode addon which currently includes major support for these content mods included in the associated mod pack:
[list]
	[*] Calamity Mod (obviously)
	[*] Thorium Mod
	[*] Secrets of the Shadows
	[*] Consolaria
[/list]

The only mods required for this API to run are Calamity Mod, Infernum Mode, Revengence+, Thrower Unification, Infernum Sanctuary WorldGen Adjuster, and any dependency included with those mods.

This API currently adds the following:
[list]
	[*] Over 500+ Toggleable balance changes to many of the weapons and items from the included mods in the main pack to help the experience flow together better.
	[*] Merged crafting trees for many accessories trees.
	[*]	Cross-mod Infernum intros for any bosses that didn't already have one.
	[*] Boss stat adjustments for Infernum mode to keep the difficulty consistent.
	[*] Boss Rush support for all included bosses, as well as a custom "tier 6."
	[*] New music for certain points of the game.
	[*] World Generation changes to help prevent overlap between mods.
	[*] Some bugfixes to help make Infernum more multiplayer compatible.
	[*] Some minor cross-mod improvements for other mods outside main mod pack.
[/list]

It also includes some built-in systems such as:
[list]
	[*] A new rogue/thrower class merge system with custom stealth strikes for crossmod thrower weapons using [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3535746309] Thrower Unification[/url].
	[*] A new highly configurable mutliplayer respawn system that lets you set the number of respawns each player has during a bossfight (defaulted to 1 respawn in Infernum Mode).
	[*] A system that allows you to lock the Calamity difficulty.
	[*] A system that allows Astrageldon to be spawned even if Moon Lord has already been defeated.
	[*] A system that allows Infernum Mode to be played in Master Mode and Legendary Mode worlds.
[/list]

In the future, this will be a content mod that has its own story, including each of the mods in the mod pack in the future, with a functional reworked boss progression using the QuestBookUI & tPackBuilder.

The mod pack was designed with Multiplayer compatibility in mind, but there are still no promises that this will work fully yet, as I am still testing and developing it.
